# Security and Innovation in Ticker Token: A Developer's Perspective

As the blockchain ecosystem grows, the need for secure and innovative smart contracts becomes increasingly important. **Ticker Token** is a prime example of how these two elements can be combined to create a powerful ERC-20 token with built-in features that enhance both usability and security.

## The Security Measures in Ticker Token

Ticker Token's contract includes several security features that protect users and their assets:

1. **Reentrancy Guard:** The use of the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin ensures that the contract is protected against reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in smart contracts.
2. **Access Control:** Specific functions in the Ticker Token contract, such as initializing liquidity and collecting fees, are restricted to the contract's creator and factory, preventing unauthorized access.
3. **Fallback Function:** A fallback function is included to handle unexpected ETH transfers, ensuring the contract's stability and integrity.

## Innovative Features

Ticker Token is not just about security; it also introduces several innovative features:

- **Automated Fee Collection:** The contract automatically collects a 0.3% fee on every swap, which is used for development and maintenance.
- **Built-in AMM:** The Automated Market Maker (AMM) ensures that users can easily swap ETH for Ticker Token without needing an external platform.

These features make Ticker Token a standout choice for developers looking to create secure, user-friendly ERC-20 tokens with advanced functionalities.

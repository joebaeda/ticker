# How Ticker Token’s AMM Revolutionizes Token Swaps

The introduction of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) has revolutionized how users trade digital assets on decentralized exchanges. **Ticker Token** leverages this innovative technology to provide a seamless swapping experience between ETH and the Ticker Token itself.

## What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?

An AMM is a smart contract that provides liquidity and facilitates the automatic trading of assets. In the case of Ticker Token, the AMM ensures that users can swap ETH for tokens without the need for a traditional order book.

### How Ticker Token's AMM Works

Ticker Token's AMM operates on a simple yet effective mechanism:

1. **Liquidity Provision:** The creator of Ticker Token initializes the liquidity pool with both ETH and tokens.
2. **Fee Collection:** A 0.3% fee is applied to every swap, which is automatically deducted and stored for future use.
3. **Price Determination:** The AMM calculates the price of the token based on the current reserves of ETH and tokens, ensuring that the price is always fair and reflects market conditions.

This built-in AMM makes Ticker Token an attractive option for both developers and traders looking to simplify the process of token swaps on the Ethereum network.
